Gemini is an open source cluster manager responsible for deploying, managing, and maintaining clustering systems.

Gemini intends on supporting multiple clustering systems such as [Kubernetes](http://kubernetes.io/), [Apache Mesos](http://mesos.apache.org/), [Docker Swarm](https://www.docker.com/products/docker-swarm), and others. Currently, Gemini supports the following cluster formation:

* **Cluster Type**: [Kubernetes](http://kubernetes.io/)
* **Cluster OS**: [CoreOS](https://coreos.com/)
* **Cluster Target**: BareMetal|[Vagrant](https://www.vagrantup.com/)

Gemini includes abstractions for grouping clusters in loosely and tightly coupled formations, and provides mechanisms for clusters to communicate with each other in familiar ways.

The key features of Gemini are:

* **simple**: install, interfaces, operations, integration
* **lean**: lightweight, accessible
* **portable**: public, private, hybrid, multi-cloud
* **extensible**: modular, pluggable, composable

Gemini builds upon best-of-breed open source technologies.
